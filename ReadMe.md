This is Carter's Weird Unnamed RTS Project.


The core premise of this project is that war is hell, and being a commander is a difficult, risky, and stressful job.
To that end, I want the problems you face in the game to be the same problems real military leaders face:
	Imperfect Information
	Limited resources
	Unrealistic objectives
	Tools that don't match the task at hand
	Being responsible for thousands of men's lives




Realism
	Precision
		Physically simulated ballistics using real data to calculate drag coefficients and armor penetration
		Fuel consumption rates scale with engine power and loads

	Scale
		Distances and sizes are to real scale
		Realistically slow combat -- controls to speed up and slow down time
		Unit conversions for player convenience
	Fragility
		If someone gets injured, they've got to be sent home
		If something gets damaged, repairing it requires time and logistics
		If people get lost, they have to be rescued
	Imbalance
		In real war, there is no balance team
		The performance of a unit IRL should roughly correspond to its in game analogue
		

Imperfect information
	Vision
		Physically simulated line of sight based on terrain height and Earth's curvature
		Weather and terrain affect vision
		You lose vision of friendly units when they're out of your direct line of sight
	Contact
		Out-of-sight friendly units can be given orders, but time lag is a factor
		Out-of-sight friendly units can send reports that are added to the map
	Radio
		Radios can be used to talk to friendlies outside vision range
		Radio transmissions aren't 100% reliable
		Radio transmissions can be triangulated or intercepted and read by the enemy
